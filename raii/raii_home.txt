1. Supply additional checks whether file exists or can be opened for reading.

2. Open file for writing and implement 'void write(const std::vector<std::string>& lines)' method.

3. Implement class 'SmartPointer' pointing to an array of integers. It should allocate N * sizeof(int) bytes
in ctor and release them in ~dtor. Make samples.
